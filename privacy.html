 Privacy Policy

BIBLE WATCH is designed to display time and Bible verses with ambient animation effects. We apply minimalism to design and to data handling.

- We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.

### What We Don’t Do

- No login or account creation
- No tracking or analytics
- No background data collection
- No ads or ad networks
- No access to contacts, camera, microphone, or location

BIBLE WATCH runs entirely on your device. It displays a clock and Bible verses mapped to time, with optional overlay animations.

### Permissions Used (and Why)

Permission | Used For | Collected?
---|---:|:---:
SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW | To display Bible Watch above other apps | ❌ No data collected
FOREGROUND_SERVICE | To keep the clock running smoothly in overlay mode | ❌ No data collected

You are in control. You can disable the overlay or animations at any time.

### Data Storage

All settings are stored locally on your device. We do not upload, transmit, or sync any information to external servers.

### Our Faith in Transparency

BIBLE WATCH is built to inspire—not to intrude. We created this app to bring Scripture into your daily life, not to harvest your data. If our privacy policy ever changes, you’ll find it here—simple and clear.
